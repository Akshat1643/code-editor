# Collaborative Code Editor with Real-Time Code Updates

This is a collaborative code editor project that allows multiple users to edit code together in real-time. It consists of a frontend built with React, a backend developed using Node.js, and MongoDB as the database. Real-time collaboration is achieved using WebSocket technology through the Socket.io library. Below, you'll find more details about the project structure and the technologies used.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend

- **React** (v18.2.0): The frontend of the application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- **React Router Dom** (v6.15.0): Used for handling client-side routing in the application.

- **Socket.io Client** (v4.7.2): This library enables real-time communication between the frontend and backend for collaborative code editing.

- **VM** (v1.0.0): A library for creating virtual machines in the browser, used for running code snippets for python in a secure environment.

- **Testing Library**:
    - `@testing-library/jest-dom` (v5.17.0)
    - `@testing-library/react` (v13.4.0)
    - `@testing-library/user-event` (v13.5.0): These libraries are used for testing React components and user interactions.

- **Web Vitals** (v2.1.4): Helps monitor and improve the performance of the application.


### Backend

- **Node.js**: The backend is implemented in Node.js, a server-side JavaScript runtime.

- **Express** (v4.18.2): A web application framework for Node.js used for routing and handling HTTP requests.

- **Socket.io** (v4.7.2): Facilitates real-time communication between the frontend and backend, allowing multiple users to collaborate on code simultaneously.

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used for storing application data.

- **Mongoose** (v7.5.0): An ODM (Object-Document Mapping) library for MongoDB, used for defining the data schema and interacting with the database.

- **Redis** (v4.6.8): An in-memory data store used for caching and improving application performance.

- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** (v9.0.2): Used for user authentication and authorization.

- **bcryptjs** (v2.4.3): A library for hashing passwords before storing them in the database.

- **express-validator** (v7.0.1): Middleware for request validation.

- **body-parser** (v1.20.2) and **cors** (v2.8.5): Middleware used for parsing incoming request bodies and handling CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) respectively.

### Development Dependencies

- **Mocha** (v10.2.0) and **Chai** (v4.3.8): Testing frameworks used for writing and executing backend tests.

- **Supertest** (v6.3.3): A library for testing HTTP requests and responses in the backend.

- **Socket.io Client** (v4.7.2): Used for testing WebSocket functionality in the frontend.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required dependencies for both the frontend and backend by running `npm install` in their respective directories.

3. Configure the database connection and other environment variables as needed.

4. Start the frontend and backend servers using `npm start` or the appropriate command.

These routes and controllers form the backbone of the collaborative code editor application's backend, allowing users to create and manage rooms for real-time code collaboration and manage their user accounts. The response structures provide clear guidance on the expected data format in both successful and error scenarios. Authentication tokens are required for most operations to ensure security and user access control.

# Configuration Setup

To run the collaborative code editor project successfully, you'll need to set up a `config.js` file with the following configuration parameters. This file will help configure various aspects of the application, such as database connection, user authentication, room validation, and more. Additionally, there's a note on changing frontend fetch request URLs to match your backend server URL.

Here's how you can create and set up the `config.js` file:

1. Create a file named `config.js` in the root directory of your backend project.

2. Open the `config.js` file and add the following configuration parameters:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  db: {
    url: 'mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database-name' // Replace with your MongoDB database URL
  },
  user: {
    name: {
      length: 5
    },
    password: {
      saltRounds: 10,
      length: 8
    }
  },
  room: {
    name: {
      length: 5
    },
    description: {
      length: 5
    }
  },
  jwt: {
    secret: 'your-secret-key' // Replace with a strong and unique secret key for JWT
  },
  port: 4000, // Port on which your backend server will run
  cors: {
    origin: 'http://localhost:3000' // Replace with the origin URL of your frontend application
  }
}
```

Make sure to replace the placeholders with your actual configuration values.

**Note:** To ensure that your frontend fetch requests communicate with the backend correctly, update the URLs in your frontend code where you make API requests to match the URL where your backend server is hosted. For example, if your backend server is running on a different host or port, update the `origin` value in the `cors` configuration to allow requests from the correct frontend URL. Additionally, replace `'http://localhost:3000'` with the URL of your frontend application in the frontend code where you make fetch requests to the backend.

With the `config.js` file properly configured, your collaborative code editor project will have the necessary settings for database connection, user authentication, and more.
